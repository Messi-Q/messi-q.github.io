                    Smart contracts hold digital coins worth billions of dollars, their security issues have drawn
                    extensive attention in the past years. Towards smart contract vulnerability detection, conventional
                    methods heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low accuracy and poor scalability. Recent deep
                    learning approaches alleviate this issue but fail to encode useful expert knowledge. In this paper,
                    we explore combining deep learning with expert patterns in an explainable fashion. Specifically, we
                    develop automatic tools to extract expert patterns from the source code. We then cast the code into
                    a semantic graph to extract deep graph features. Thereafter, the global graph feature and local
                    expert patterns are fused to cooperate and approach the final prediction, while yielding their
                    interpretable weights. Experiments are conducted on all available smart contracts with source code
                    in two platforms, Ethereum and VNT Chain. Empirically, our system significantly outperforms
                    state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released.

                    Smart contract vulnerability detection draws extensive attention in recent years due to the substantial losses caused by
                    hacker attacks. Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and
                    non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty
                    attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to
                    achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts,
                    there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks.
                    In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically,
                    we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph,
                    we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network
                    to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final
                    detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain
                    platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of vulnerabilities,
                    where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15%, 89.02%, and 83.21% for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite
                    loop vulnerabilities, respectively.

                    The security problems of smart contracts have
                    drawn extensive attention due to the enormous financial
                    losses caused by vulnerabilities. Existing
                    methods on smart contract vulnerability detection
                    heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low
                    detection accuracy. In this paper, we explore using
                    graph neural networks (GNNs) for smart contract
                    vulnerability detection. Particularly, we construct a
                    contract graph to represent both syntactic and semantic
                    structures of a smart contract function. To
                    highlight the major nodes, we design an elimination
                    phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose
                    a degree-free graph convolutional neural network
                    (DR-GCN) and a novel temporal message propagation
                    network (TMP) to learn from the normalized
                    graphs for vulnerability detection. Extensive experiments
                    show that our proposed approach significantly
                    outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting
                    three different types of vulnerabilities.

                <p>
                    The protection of digital resource copyrights has drawn extensive public concern in the past decade.
                    Traditional methods, however, fail to satisfy the requirements due to their poor timeliness,
                    frequent infringement, and cumbersome in rights confirmation, etc. In this paper, we investigate and
                    design a novel approach for cross-platform digital resource rights confirmation and infringement
                    tracking based on smart contracts. We utilize smart contracts to realize rights transactions and
                    protection. As another contribution, we propose to establish fine-grained digital resource rights,
                    which are divided into ownership and usufruct. For tracking infringement acts, we invoke smart
                    contracts to extract the rights transfer chain for resources. Furthermore, we reveal the source of
                    resource leakage by embedding digital watermarks when distributing the resources. By combining
                    resource rights transfer chain and digital watermarking, we can effectively achieve digital resource
                    rights confirmation and infringement tracking. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our
                    proposed method.
